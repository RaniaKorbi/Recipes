        <item>This soup from Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease is so good we ate it ALL the first time we made it. If someone is hesitant about plant-based food, this has to be a convincer. Red lentils keep this soup a beautiful orange color. If you don’t have leeks use onions. Serve it alone or over rice with a big green salad.</item>
        <item>If you want to eat something sweet and easy to prepare, this is definitely an excellent option for you! This delicious lime mousse is simple, quite pleasant and has excellent presentation!</item>

        <item>Ingredients
4 slices whole grain bread
 1 bunch of kale or chard, center rib removed and chopped in bite sized pieces (4 cups or more)
 1/4-1/3 cup hummus
 a few green onions, light green parts only (save the rest for soup), sliced thin
 2 tbsp chopped cilantro or parsley leaves
 1 lemon
 Finishing oil (sunflower or olive)
 salt and pepper
 1 large tomato, sliced in 4 thick slices (optional)
1
For the lemon, zest the ends and then remove about 1 inch from each stem end side. Juice these ends and reserve. VERY thinly slice the center section, and remove any seeds as you go.
2
Toast your bread really well, to an almost cracker-like texture.
3
Blanch the kale: bring 3-4 inches of water to a boil, drop in kale cover and cook until tender, 3 minutes. Quickly drop into an ice water bath, or rinse until freezing water to stop the cooking process. Pat/squeeze dry with towels. Sprinkle the tender kale with lemon zest and lemon juice, and tear up into small pieces, and allow to sit while you prep the sandwiches.
4
Spread toast thickly with hummus, sprinkle green onions on the hummus, pile cilantro on top of the green onions and then place a few super thing lemon slices on the cilantro.
5
Then put a big handful of lemoney-kale on top of each piece of bread. Drizzle a little bit of oil on top, and crack some salt and pepper. It's delicious as is, or top with a tomato slice.

        <item>Ingredients
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 medium carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
Sea salt
1 cup sliced shiitakes (fresh or frozen)
4 medium garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup French green lentils, picked through for stones and rinsed
6 cups vegetable stock* (low sodium, if possible)
1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce (no salt added, if possible)
1 14-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes (no salt added, if possible)
1 medium sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch dice
Optional (to serve): fresh thyme, basil, parsley or cilantro, cubed avocado, sour cream, toasted sourdough, tortilla chips
Instructions
Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot (I use a Dutch oven) over medium-low heat and add the onion, carrots, celery, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir to coat and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 7 minutes.
Add the shiitakes and cook for another 2 minutes (a little longer if using frozen). Stir in the garlic, thyme, paprika, and black pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add the lentils, stock, and tomatoes. Raise the heat to high, cover tightly with a lid, and bring to a boil.
Add the sweet potatoes, reduce the heat to low, and simmer with the lid ajar until the lentils and sweet potato are cooked through**, 25-30 minutes. Season with pepper and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt, or to taste.
To serve, garnish with fresh herbs and extra black pepper. Serve with avocado, sour cream, bread, or tortilla chips, if desired.

        <item>Ingredients
Ingredient Checklist
¼ cup water
1 envelope unflavored gelatin (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
1 ½ cups sugar, divided
4 teaspoons finely grated lime zest (from 5 Key limes or 2 regular limes), plus more for garnish (see Tips)
2/3 cup fresh lime juice (from 18-20 Key limes or 4-6 regular limes)
¼ teaspoon salt
6 large egg yolks or pasteurized-in-the-shell egg yolks (see Tips)
7 large egg whites or pasteurized egg whites
1 ½ cups reduced-fat plain Greek yogurt
Step 1
Pour water into a small heatproof glass bowl and sprinkle with gelatin. Let stand until softened, about 3 minutes. Heat about 1 inch of water in a small skillet over low heat. Place the bowl in the pan and stir until the gelatin has dissolved and the liquid is clear. (Alternatively, microwave the gelatin mixture, uncovered, on High until the gelatin has completely dissolved but the liquid is not boiling, 20 to 40 seconds.) Set aside.
Step 2
Combine 1 cup sugar and lime zest in a food processor and process until the zest is finely ground. Transfer to a large saucepan and add lime juice and salt. Heat over medium heat until very hot, whisking until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat. Whisk egg yolks in a medium heatproof bowl. Whisking constantly, very slowly add the lime juice mixture, beginning with just a few drops and gradually increasing the amount.
Step 3
Return the mixture to the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, 2 to 4 minutes. Immediately transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large deep bowl if using a hand mixer). Beat starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high until very thick and pale, 3 to 5 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly dribble in the gelatin mixture and continue to beat on medium-high speed until the mixture cools to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Clean the beaters.
Step 4
Beat egg whites in another mixing bowl on medium speed just until foamy. Increase speed to medium-high and sprinkle in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat just until the egg whites hold stiff peaks when the beaters are lifted.
Step 5
With a whisk, fold yogurt into the lime custard. Then fold in the egg whites in 3 batches. Evenly divide the mixture among ten 8-ounce ramekins (or transfer to a 2 1/2-quart round dish, such as a souffle dish).
Step 6
Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled and set, at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. Garnish with more lime zest before serving, if desired.

Ingredient Checklist
½ cup Parmesan cheese
¼ cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
¼ teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon onion powder
⅛ teaspoon celery salt
2 pounds tilapia fillets
Step 1
Preheat your oven's broiler. Grease a broiling pan or line pan with aluminum foil.
Step 2
In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Season with dried basil, pepper, onion powder and celery salt. Mix well and set aside.
Step 3
Arrange fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan. Broil a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over and broil for a couple more minutes. Remove the fillets from the oven and cover them with the Parmesan cheese mixture on the top side. Broil for 2 more minutes or until the topping is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork. Be careful not to over cook the fish.
